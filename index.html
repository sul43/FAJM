<h1>Jebamoni (PAKHI)</h1>
<h3>I know a girl who is incredibly beautiful, cute, and pretty—words truly cannot describe her! And her eyes? MashaAllah! Allah has made them so beautiful that they leave me in awe. Of course, I'm talking about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jebamoni__?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Jebamoni</a>(Pakhi).<p>

</p>I’ve known her for a long time, but we officially started talking exactly 324 days ago—nearly a year now. When I first saw her, I thought to myself, 'How can a child be this beautiful!' I later found out she is actually older than me, so I probably shouldn't call her a 'child' anymore, right? But honestly, her age doesn't change anything for me. Even if she is older, she still has that same childlike innocence and sweetness that I first fell for. She truly has a heart of gold.</h3>
<h2>HER</h2>

            <li>kind</li>
            <li>Soft hearted</li>
            <li>I can't take my eyes off her</li>
            <li>Her eyes have a universe in them.</li>
            <li>Every moment with her feels magical</li>
            <li>Her voice is the calm in my chaos</li>
            <li>The whole world fades, and she's all I see</li>
            <li>No matter how busy life gets, she's on my mind</li>
            <li>Everything feels right when she's around</li>
            <li>There are many beautiful women, but she's my only one</li>
    </ul>
